Triangle
========

In Euclidean geometry any three points, when non-collinear, determine a
unique triangle and simultaneously, a unique plane (i.e. a
two-dimensional Euclidean space). In other words, there is only one
plane that contains that triangle, and every triangle is contained in
some plane. If the entire geometry is only the Euclidean plane, there is
only one plane and all triangles are contained in it; however, in
higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces, this is no longer true. This
article is about triangles in Euclidean geometry, and in particular, the
Euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted.

Area of a Triangle
------------------

Can be calculated using **Heron's Formula**. Given three sides of length
a, b, c

-   $s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}$

-   $A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$
