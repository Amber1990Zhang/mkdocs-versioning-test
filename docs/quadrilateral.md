4 sided quadrilateral
=====================

In Euclidean plane geometry, a quadrilateral is a polygon with four
edges (or sides) and four vertices or corners. Sometimes, the term
quadrangle is used, by analogy with triangle, and sometimes tetragon for
consistency with pentagon (5-sided), hexagon (6-sided) and so on.
